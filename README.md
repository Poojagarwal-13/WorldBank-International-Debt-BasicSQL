# WorldBank-International-Debt-BasicSQL
Analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank using basic SQL queries.

This project is created as part of DataCamp Project ["Analyze International Debt Statistics"] (https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/754).

### Project Description

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators? The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.


### Project Insights

There are 124 countries in the dataset, and their combined debt to the World Bank totals approximately $3 trillion. 

The country with the highest debt is China, which owes roughly $286 billion. 

Of the various debt indicators, principal repayments on long-term external debt (DT.AMT.DLXF.CD) is the indicator for which countries owe the highest amount.  China owe the highest amount for this indicator.

Common debt categories among all countries include public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt from official creditors (DT.INT.OFFT.CD, debt from international organizations and governments) and interest payments on long-term external debt (DT.INT.DLXF.CD). 

Of the countries that owe the most debt in any one category, China leads with $96 billion for repaying long-term debt, followed by Brazil, which owes $90 billion in the same area.
